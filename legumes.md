# Introduction to Legumes

A legume is a plant belonging to the family _Fabaceae_. They produce seeds in pods.

Legumes are grown primarily for human consumption and livestock forage.

_Pulses_ are legumes that are harvested for dry beans. Example Dhal, Lentil, Chickpea etc

**Examples**

**Human Consumption**
* Pigeon Peas (_Cajanas cajan_)
* Green Bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_)
* Bodi (_Vigna unguiculata subsp. Ses_)
* Seim (_Lablab purpureus_)
* Tamarind

**Animal Forage**
* Kudzu (_Pueraria montana_)
* (_Gliricidia sepium_)
* Leucaena leucocephala
* Acacia


## Nitrogen Fixation

Leguminous plants are unique in that they naturally fix nitrogen in the soil. Convert atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogenous compounds useful to plants.

Root nodules containing the bacteria Rhizobium fix nitrogen.

In return, the legumes supply the bacteria with the products of photosynthesis.

## Intercropping

Crops are grown among plant of a different kind. Usually in the space between rows.

Legumes are a key functional group. Can use them with plants that need the nitrogen that they fix.

The practice can also maximize profits by planting fast producers along with slow ones.

Choice of crops is important because of competition among crops.

**Example of main and legumes.**

* Higher yield and greater utilization of available resources
* Benefits in weeds
* Pest and disease management
* Fixation of biological nitrogen by legumes and transfer of N to associated maize
* Insurance against crop failure
* Control of erosion by covering a large extent of ground area

**Disadvantages**
* Less scope of farm mechanization
* Dependence on more human workforce


## Pigeon Peas (_Cajanas cajan_)

Also known as red gram, tur, or as gungo peas.
Grown as a pulse crop or eaten green as cooked vegetable.


Short lived, perennial shrub. Lives for about five years.
The flowers are bell-shaped are usually borne in pairs and may be yellow, or yellow and red.


### Photoperiodism

The response to changes in day-length that enables plants to adapt to seasonal changes in their environment.

Pigeon pea is considered to have a quantitative short-day response.

### Land Preparation

* Well-drained soils and a hot environment
* Can be direct seeded in planting mounds or in planting crates
* 2-3 plants per mound


### Apical Dominance

The growing apex of a plant controls the dormancy of buds sitting in lower positions along a shoot. Plants with strong apical dominance, the growth is very upright with one dominant central axis.

Auxin, migrates slowly via the phloem inhibits the sprouting of axillary buds sitting lower on the shoot.

Pruning or adding hormones cause branching instead of strong apical dominance.

This is preferable where you want branching since flowering occurs at nodes.

### Maturity

* 65-80 days
* 50-75 extra days for seeds

### Improved Varieties

* less sensitive to day length
* mature, flower and produce over a shorter period
* dwarf in size (easier to pick)
* grow less after flowering
* produce pods at top of plant. Helps with mechanical harvesting.
