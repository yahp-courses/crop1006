# Fertilizer Management

**Building blocks**
* C H O - 75% (water and carbon)

**Macro Nutrients**

* N P K - 15% (_primary_)
* Ca Mg S - 7% (_secondary_)

**Micro Nutrients** (__trace elements_)
* Mg, B, Mo, Cu, Zn, Fe - 3%

Things in crop production that cannot se and can't control.

## Nitrogen

Important for _vegetative_ growth. 
Fertilizers have advanced forms of nitrogen that are easier to take up by plants.

### Deficiency

* Stunted growth.
* Leaf growth is inhibited
* Yellow coloration 
	(this can also be caused by insect attacks, though)

_Chlorosis_ - yellowing
_Necrosis_ - further state of damage (brown)

## Phosphorous

Promotes root development.

### Deficiency

* stunted in growth
* abnormal dark green color
	leaves can also become purple in color (this can also occur due to herbicides as well)

(too much can lead to leaf tip burn)

## Potassium

Responsible for flowering and fruiting.
Moves from lower to upper leaves.

### Deficiency 

* Outer edges of leaves turn brown.

Application is dependent of _mobility_ of nutrients (how the nutrients move in the soil water)

* Nitrogen is very mobile. Don't place on top of soil, they can get lost due to rain. Punch a hole.

* Phosphorous is immobile, does not move at all. Don't place on top of soil, roots won't get it. _Deep placement_.
	Not directly in the root zone though, can cause burning.

	**What is fertigation?** Coating phosphorous molecule so it is not recognisable by the soil. So they won't be bonded to the soil.

* Potassium is a little less mobile than Nitrogen

Localised application (per plant) is best - use less, and don't feed the weeds etc.

One of the easiest ways is at bed formation.

Ideally use the "chileated ?"

If you don't put the immobile nutrients first, the other more mobile ones will come in easier and take up all the "space".

# Fertilizers

Any material that is applied to soil to supply one or more plant nutrients essential for optimum growth.

Can be organic and inorganic/synthetic

## Organic

Obtained from plants and animals.

## Inorganic

Chemical, contain nutrient elements

* Straight Fertilizers: contain one nutrient (eg. urea - nitrogen, tsp - phosphorous, mop - potassium)
* Compounded: Have two or more nutrients (Always read NPK in a ratio)  
	The highest number categorizes the fertilizer (growing, rooting, bearing)  
	A fourth number would be one of the secondary nutrients  
	8:16:32 - A good sweet potato ratio

---

* In the early stages of plant -> need phosphorous for the roots

* After, need nitrogen
	Always back up nitrogen with calcium. Nitrogen gives rapid growth, but with weaker cell walls, lower shelf life.

# Application 

## Fators to be considered
* crop growth
* stage of crop growth (phosphorous for new roots)
* soil factors ()
* field history (what were the problems before)
* cost of fertilizers

## Methods of Application

* Broadcasting - Just scattering

* Placement:
	* Deep placement
	* Basal (at the base of the plant):
		* spot
		* band
		* row

* Foliar

* Water salting/Fertigating
