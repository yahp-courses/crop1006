# Introduction to Vegetables

**What is a vegetable**
A **vegetable** is any plant or part of plant which is used for food.

Vegetables can be classified by botanical classification, plant part used and life cycle.

_Hrticultural maturity_ is the part of the plant that is most valuable to market.  
For instance, do you want them very mature (tomatoes) or young (ochroes, cucumber)


## Classification by Plant Parts

Part | Description | Examples
--- | --- | ---
Bulbs | Usually grow just below the surface of the ground and produce a fleshy, leafy shoot above ground. Bulbs usually consist of layers or clustered segments. | Fennel, garlic, leek, onion, shallot, spring onion
Flowers | The edible flowers of certain vegetables. | Cauliflower, broccoli
Fruit | Vegetable fruit are flesh and contain seeds. | Cucumber, eggplant, pumpkin and squash tomato
Leaves | The edible leaves of plants. | Bok choy, brussels sprouts, cabbage, lettuce, spinach
Roots/Tubers | Usually a long or round-shaped taproot. | Beetroot, carrot, radish, sweet potato, cassava, yam
Seeds | (Legumes) apart from sweet corn, seeds grow in pods which are sometimes eaten along with the seed. | Chick pea, pigeon pea, corn

### Bulbs

* Collection of underground leaves that store food and water at the center of the bulb
* Leaves are visible as layers
* They only occur in monocots with a single embryonic leaf.
* Bulbs are usually rounded or egg-shaped
* The roots emerge from the basal plate of the bulbs
* Examples - Onions, chives, garlic

### Corms

* Corns are modified stems with a tunic. They are a type of stem tissue differentiated to store nutrients.
* Have a fibrous covering known as a *tunic* and the roots emerge from a smooth area at the base known as the _basal plate_.
* Examples - Dasheen, Eddoes, Crocus

### Tubers

Undifferentiated stem.

* They lack a basal plate
* Most roots develop from the bottom of the tuber
* Some have organized growing points called ees at the top.
* Two types:
	1. **Stem Tubers** such as Irish potatoes are underground stems
	2. **Root Tubers** such as Beets are underground roots.
* Examples - Potatoes, Beet, Carrots

### Rhizomes

* Swollen underground stems which grow horizontally under the soil.
* New growing points occur along the surface of the rhizomes.
* Examples - Ginger, Turmeric, Bamboo, Asparagus


#### Similarities between bulbs, corms, tubers, and rhizomes

* They are all underground storage units.
* Called _geophytes_.
* Can develop a new plant under favorable conditions.

## Classification by Botanical Classification

* Universally accepted
* It is based on _morphological_ (form and structure) and cytological siilarites and dissimilarities, place of origin, crossability behaior, and floral biology.
* Involves grouping into kindgom, division, sub-division, pyhlum, sub-phylum, class sub-class order, family, genus species, sub-species, and variety.
